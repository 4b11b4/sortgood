You must mention what algorithms you are specifically targeting.
Are you doing Quicksort? if yes what kind of pivots will you choose and how? What partitioning schemes?

What about initiative/originality in the final report?
I don't see any feature in the proposal related to that. e.g., switching from quicksort to insertion sort for small arrays would be a very interesting feature.

Also you must mention in the final report any strategy for version control management.

Thank you,
Paul
